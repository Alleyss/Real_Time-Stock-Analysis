Okay, let's build a detailed, phased roadmap for your "Real-Time Stock Analysis Using Sentiment Analysis" project. We'll focus on getting a functional MVP first, then iteratively adding the advanced features and preparing for future enhancements like fine-tuning.

Guiding Principles:

Iterative Development: Build core functionality first, then enhance.

Focus on Value: Each phase should deliver a tangible improvement or capability.

Flexibility: Design with future enhancements (API, fine-tuning) in mind.

Testing: Integrate testing throughout the process.

Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Est. Time: 1-2 days)

Project Setup:

Create a main project directory.

Initialize Git: git init. Create a .gitignore file (include venv/, __pycache__/, API keys, potentially SQLite DB file if not versioning data).

Set up Python Virtual Environment: python -m venv venv and activate it.

Install Core Libraries:

pip install streamlit yfinance newsapi-python requests beautifulsoup4 transformers torch torchvision torchaudio (or tensorflow if preferred) pandas

(Note: transformers will pull in PyTorch or TensorFlow; ensure you have the one you prefer)

API Key Management:

Sign up for NewsAPI and get your key.

Decide on a secure way to store it (Environment variables are best, .env file loaded with python-dotenv is a good alternative for local dev). Do not commit API keys to Git.

Basic Project Structure:

main.py (or app.py): Your main Streamlit application file.

data_fetcher.py: Module for functions fetching data (NewsAPI, Yfinance, initial scraping).

sentiment_analyzer.py: Module for sentiment analysis logic.

database.py: Module for all SQLite interactions (setup, CRUD operations).

config.py (or use .env): For storing constants, API keys (loaded from env), model names.

requirements.txt: Generate with pip freeze > requirements.txt.

Initial Database Setup (database.py):

Function to connect to stocks_analysis.db.

Function to create initial tables (e.g., Stocks with ticker, company_name; NewsArticles with id, ticker, headline, source, url, content (nullable initially), published_at, fetched_at). Design for future sentiment storage.

Phase 1: MVP - US Stock Analysis (Est. Time: 1-2 weeks)

Streamlit UI (Basic):

Input field for US stock ticker (st.text_input).

Button to trigger analysis (st.button).

Placeholders for displaying:

Stock Info (st.json or st.metric).

News Headlines (st.write or st.dataframe).

Sentiment Score/Suggestion (st.info/success/warning/error).

Validation points (st.markdown bullet points).

Use st.spinner while processing.

Data Fetching (US Stocks Only - data_fetcher.py):

Implement get_stock_info(ticker) using yfinance.

Implement get_us_news(ticker_or_company_name) using NewsAPI. Fetch headlines, URLs, sources, published dates.

Error handling for API calls (invalid ticker, API limits).

Data Storage (Basic - database.py):

Function to save fetched stock info (if needed beyond display).

Function to save fetched news articles (headlines, metadata) to the NewsArticles table. Avoid duplicates based on URL or title/timestamp.

Sentiment Analysis (Core - sentiment_analyzer.py):

Model Loading:

Choose initial model (e.g., ProsusAI/finbert or distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english for faster startup, or jump to roberta-base).

Load model and tokenizer using transformers.pipeline("sentiment-analysis", ...) or AutoModelForSequenceClassification and AutoTokenizer.

Crucially, cache the model loading using @st.cache_resource in your Streamlit app to avoid reloading on every interaction.

Analysis Logic:

Function analyze_sentiment_for_ticker(ticker, time_window_days=1):

Fetch recent news headlines for the ticker from the DB (or fetch directly if not storing yet).

Run sentiment analysis on each headline.

Aggregate results (e.g., average score, count positive/negative).

Chunking (Defer if only analyzing headlines): If analyzing full content later, plan where chunking logic will go.

Suggestion Engine (Simple - sentiment_analyzer.py or main.py):

Function get_suggestion(aggregated_sentiment_score):

Implement initial simple threshold logic (e.g., if score > 0.5: return "Buy" etc.). Define the 5 levels.

Validation Points (Basic - sentiment_analyzer.py or main.py):

Function get_validation_points(news_articles_with_sentiment):

Identify the top 1-2 most positive and/or negative headlines based on their sentiment score.

Return these headlines as bullet points.

Integration (main.py):

On button click:

Get ticker from input.

Call data fetching functions.

(Optional) Save data to DB.

Call sentiment analysis function.

Call suggestion function.

Call validation points function.

Display all results in the Streamlit UI placeholders.

Use @st.cache_data for functions that return data based on inputs (like fetching news for a ticker within a timeframe) to speed up reruns with the same inputs.

Initial Testing: Test with various US tickers (tech, finance, consumer goods). Check if sentiment makes intuitive sense. Debug API calls, data flow, UI updates.

Phase 2: Enhancements & Indian Stock Integration (Est. Time: 2-3 weeks)

Indian Stock Data Fetching (data_fetcher.py):

Yfinance: Check yfinance coverage for Indian tickers (.NS, .BO). Use it if sufficient for basic price/info.

Scraping (requests+bs4):

Identify 1-2 target Indian financial news websites.

Analyze their structure (HTML tags for headlines, links, dates). Check robots.txt.

Implement scraper function scrape_indian_news(ticker) using requests and BeautifulSoup4. Handle potential request blocks (user-agents, headers).

Robust error handling for scraping failures.

Ticker Handling: Modify input logic/data fetching to differentiate between US and Indian tickers and call the appropriate functions.

Database Enhancements (database.py):

Ensure NewsArticles table comfortably stores data from both NewsAPI and scrapers (source field is important).

Add columns needed for advanced features: sentiment_score (numeric), sentiment_label (text). Maybe analysis_version if models change.

Sentiment Analysis Upgrade (sentiment_analyzer.py):

Full Content (Optional but recommended): Modify data fetching/scraping to get article text (or first N paragraphs). Update DB schema (content column).

Chunking: Implement logic to split longer article content into chunks suitable for the Transformer model (e.g., 400-500 tokens per chunk).

Analysis Refinement: Update analyze_sentiment_for_ticker to:

Fetch full content if available.

Chunk the content.

Run sentiment analysis on each chunk.

Aggregate chunk sentiments per article.

Aggregate article sentiments for the ticker. Store results (sentiment_score, sentiment_label) back into the NewsArticles table or a separate SentimentResults table.

Model Choice: Solidify choice (finbert-tone, roberta-base etc.). Ensure it handles neutral sentiment if desired.

Suggestion Engine Refinement (sentiment_analyzer.py):

Improve threshold logic based on MVP testing and potentially the volume of positive/negative news, not just the average score. Make it more nuanced than simple thresholds.

Validation Points Enhancement (sentiment_analyzer.py):

Refine logic to pick validation points based on articles/chunks with the most extreme sentiment scores that contributed to the final suggestion. Extract key sentences or headlines.

Advanced Scraping (Playwright Introduction - data_fetcher.py):

Install Playwright: pip install playwright and playwright install.

Experiment: Try rewriting one of the scrapers (especially if it struggles with JavaScript) using Playwright's async API or sync API. This is more complex but handles dynamic sites better.

Testing: Test extensively with both US and Indian tickers. Verify scraper reliability. Check sentiment accuracy on diverse news types. Evaluate suggestion quality.

Phase 3: Advanced Features Implementation (Est. Time: 3-4 weeks)

Implement these features one by one or grouped logically.

Historical Sentiment Trend Chart:

DB: Ensure timestamps and sentiment scores are stored reliably per article/day.

Logic: Create function get_historical_sentiment(ticker, time_period) to query the DB, aggregate sentiment scores by day/hour for the given period.

UI: Use st.line_chart or integrate Plotly (pip install plotly, st.plotly_chart) for richer charts showing sentiment score over time.

Customizable Time Window:

UI: Add st.selectbox or st.slider for users to choose the analysis window (e.g., "Last 24 hours", "Last 3 days", "Last Week").

Logic: Pass the selected time window to data fetching and sentiment analysis functions to filter news articles based on published_at before analysis. Update DB queries.

News Source Filtering:

DB: Ensure the source field is populated correctly during data fetching/scraping.

UI: Add st.multiselect populated with distinct sources found for the current ticker (or a predefined list).

Logic: Filter the fetched news data based on the user's source selection before performing sentiment analysis.

Watchlist:

DB: Create a Watchlist table (e.g., id, ticker, added_at). If multi-user planned later, add user_id.

UI:

Add an "Add to Watchlist" button on the main analysis page.

Display the watchlist (e.g., in the sidebar st.sidebar) with buttons to quickly analyze or remove stocks.

Logic: Implement functions in database.py to add/remove/get watchlist items. Load watchlist on app start.

Alerts (Complex - Consider Simplification):

Challenge: True background alerts require a separate persistent process/scheduler.

Simplified MVP Alert: When loading the watchlist, re-analyze sentiment for each stock. If the suggestion changes significantly compared to the last recorded suggestion (requires storing previous suggestion in DB), highlight it in the UI. This is "alert on load".

Full Alert System (Future/Advanced): Requires:

A scheduler (like APScheduler or a system cron job).

A script that runs periodically, fetches data for watchlist stocks, analyzes sentiment, compares to previous state, and triggers notifications (email, push - more infra). This likely runs outside Streamlit.

Phase 4: Refinement, Testing & Performance (Est. Time: 2-3 weeks)

Robustness & Error Handling:

Review all API calls, scraping logic, DB interactions. Add comprehensive try...except blocks.

Handle edge cases: Tickers with no news, API errors, scraping blocks, DB connection issues. Provide informative messages to the user.

Implement basic retry logic for flaky network requests.

Performance Optimization:

Caching: Ensure effective use of @st.cache_resource (for models, DB connections) and @st.cache_data (for data fetched/processed based on inputs).

Database Queries: Index relevant columns in SQLite tables (ticker, published_at, source). Optimize queries.

Sentiment Analysis: If analyzing many articles/chunks, consider batching inputs to the transformer model if possible (library support varies).

Profiling: If slow, use Python's cProfile or Streamlit's profiler to identify bottlenecks.

Code Quality & Structure:

Refactor code for clarity and maintainability. Ensure functions are well-defined and modules have clear responsibilities.

Add comments and docstrings.

Run a linter (like flake8 or black) to enforce style consistency.

UI/UX Polish:

Improve layout, spacing, clarity of information.

Use Streamlit components effectively (columns, expanders).

Ensure responsiveness.

Comprehensive Testing:

Manual: Test diverse tickers (high/low news volume, different sectors, US/Indian), different time windows, source filters, watchlist functionality, edge cases. Test scraper resilience over several days.

(Optional but Recommended) Automated:

Unit tests (pytest) for helper functions (data cleaning, suggestion logic, DB interactions - mock external dependencies).

Integration tests (test the flow from ticker input to suggestion display, potentially mocking external APIs/scrapers).

Configuration: Move hardcoded values (model names, thresholds, file paths) to a config file (config.py) or load from environment variables.

Logging: Implement basic logging (logging module) to record errors, key events (analysis runs, API failures, scraper issues) to a file for easier debugging.

Phase 5: Future Development (Post-MVP+ Enhancements)

Backend API Service:

Choose framework (FastAPI recommended for async and ease of use).

Refactor backend logic (data fetching, analysis, suggestion, DB interaction) into API endpoints.

Streamlit app becomes a client, making calls to these endpoints. Improves separation and scalability.

Model Fine-tuning Preparation:

Data Strategy: Decide how to generate labeled data. Possibilities:

Manually review stored news + initial sentiment, correct labels -> requires significant effort.

Use the aggregated suggestion (Buy/Sell/Hold) as a proxy label for the underlying news (less accurate but easier).

Data Export: Create scripts to export data from SQLite into formats suitable for training (e.g., CSV, Hugging Face datasets format: text, label).

Model Fine-tuning:

Choose a base model (roberta-base, etc.).

Use transformers Trainer API or standard PyTorch/TensorFlow loops to fine-tune the model on your prepared financial sentiment dataset.

Evaluate fine-tuned model performance. Integrate the better model into the application.

Integrate Volatility & Strategy:

Fetch volatility metrics using yfinance.

Define and implement your "trained strategy" logic (this is a separate complex task).

Develop a weighting or final decision mechanism to combine sentiment score, volatility, and strategy output into the final suggestion.

NLP Relevance Filtering:

Implement techniques (e.g., keyword counting, checking if ticker/company name is central, simple topic modeling) to filter out news articles where the stock is only mentioned peripherally.

Ollama / Local LLM Exploration:

Install Ollama and download a suitable model.

Experiment with using the local LLM via its API for tasks like:

More nuanced sentiment analysis (prompting).

Generating justifications/summaries instead of just extracting headlines.

Reasoning over combined sentiment + financial data (advanced).

Requires careful prompt engineering and resource management.

Deployment: Consider options like Streamlit Community Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, or deploying the backend API and Streamlit frontend separately on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

This roadmap provides a structured approach. Remember to be flexible, adapt based on challenges encountered, and frequently test your progress! Good luck!
